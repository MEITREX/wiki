## Context
Where to store the settings data.
## Options considered
- A: Store the settings in the User Database
- B: Store the settings in the service(s) they are used in. Spread out.
## Decision - Option A
- It is easier to maintain
- When multiple Services use a setting, Option B can make the architecture hard to understand
- Altough Option B has less need for communication between the services, this can be reduced by caching
