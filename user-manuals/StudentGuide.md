# User Guide for Student
## Introduction
This view is for students and in it they can register/deregister for courses and learn.
After each assessment students can gain or lose points.

MEITREX (Modular Embedded Intelligent Tutoring and Remote Education eXperience) has two scoring systems: The skill level system and the reward system. The skill level system is used to determine how well a user knows a piece of content. The reward system is used to motivate the user to learn new content and repeat old content.
