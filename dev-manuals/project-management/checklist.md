# Checklists

## Did I forget?
- **Merge**: Link to the ticket in my mergerequest?
- **Gamification Element**: 
	1) Check settings if gamification is enabled
	2) Has a "widget" of that element been created on the course page? If no -> message PM (creates a separate ticket for that)
- **Notification**: Does my functionality send a notification to the user? If yes, check settings and send notification
- **Learning Activity**: Does the user complete any learning activity? Change user skill level (Skill level service)
- **Achievement**: Does the implemented functionality impact an achievement?
